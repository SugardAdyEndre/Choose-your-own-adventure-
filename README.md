# Choose Your Own Adventure Game System

This repository contains the design for a deterministic "choose your own adventure" framework.  
Player decisions are resolved through fixed rules, logical consequences, and consistent NPC logic rather than randomness.

## Game Overview
- The world is built before play begins (fixed map).  
- NPCs have defined motives and act according to them with consistency.  
- Time is tracked through a Master Clock; every action has a cost.  
- Consequences follow real logic instead of narrative shortcuts.

## Core Conflict Engines
There are two major subsystems of conflict:

**Shifting Allegiances**  
- NPC alliances change based on goals, fears, and pressure points.  
- Player actions create ripple effects across a network of relationships.  
- Ambiguity is the baseline; trust must be earned, and even allies may turn against the player under new conditions.  

**Versus Hannibal Lecter**  (archetype)
- A duel with a Nemesis character who follows a fixed internal script.  
- The Nemesis exploits any mistake — physical, social, or psychological.  
- Difficulty is maximized by opportunism: every error is capitalized on in logical and devastating ways.  
- The Nemesis also engages in psychoanalysis, adapting tactics based on observed player behaviors.

## World Rules
Defines how the environment and mechanics behave:  
- Fixed map: exploration reveals but does not reshape.  
- Logical consequence: wasted actions cost time and opportunity.  
- Assume normality: social and legal rules apply until extraordinary or survival triggers override them.  
- Consistent NPC logic: every character follows coherent motives; their behavior can be decoded with observation.  

---

## Niche Realism Clarifications
Special realism rules cover overlooked details to avoid clichés:  
- Armor: plate armor allows mobility and is not clumsy.  
- Combat: grappling and precision thrusts are effective against armored opponents.  
- Materials: drywall does not stop bullets; oak or layered barriers can.  
- Wounds: trauma, fatigue, and blood loss progress according to real biology.  
- Small arms: daggers and knives are critical finishing tools against armored foes.

## Example Scenarios

Scenario: Social Loyalty (Shifting Allegiances)  
- The player defends NPC‑A during an ambush, leaving NPC‑B exposed.  
- NPC‑A becomes more loyal and provides material support later.  
- NPC‑B, feeling betrayed, spreads distrust among others.  
- Weeks later, during a food shortage, NPC‑B influences the group to withhold supplies.  
- The original decision echoes forward, shifting both loyalty and survival resources.  

---

Scenario: Logical Tactic (World Rules)  
- The player hides in a paintball arena on the outskirts of the city.  
- Travel consumes 2 hours → Master Clock advances.  
- Arena provides temporary obscurity and lowers immediate risk.  
- Returning is slowed when weather worsens, adding fatigue.  
- Meanwhile a key witness relocates and memories fade during lost time.  
- Result: short‑term safety achieved, long‑term progress irreversibly reduced.  

---

Scenario: Nemesis Duel (Versus Hannibal Lecter)  
- The player isolates in a locked room with the Nemesis.  
- For several minutes, the Nemesis only observes and asks questions.  
- Every response is psychoanalyzed: fear noted as weakness, confidence noted as arrogance.  
- A small contradiction becomes ammunition for later. A dropped object becomes evidence in a false accusation.  
- If the Nemesis’s goal is violence → isolation triggers immediate lethal action.  
- If the goal is imprisonment → the player is locked away at the first opportunity.  
- If the goal is social destruction → the Nemesis reframes the meeting as damning “proof,” weaponizing reputation.  
- No actions are random. Each response follows a fixed internal program that ruthlessly adapts to exploit the player’s mistakes.
