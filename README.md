# Choose Your Own Adventure Game System

This repository contains a design framework for a **rule-based, deterministic interactive game**.  
The project adapts "Choose Your Own Adventure" style play, but applies strict systems to ensure logic, consequence, and realism, rather than random or arbitrary outcomes.

## Game Overview
This system is designed for **story-driven simulations** where:  
- Choices are resolved by logic and consequence rather than dice rolls or arbitrary narration.  
- NPCs follow coherent motives and can shift loyalties dynamically.  
- Time spent is tracked by a Master Clock â€“ every action or travel choice costs time.  
- Consequences emerge from **consistent rules**, producing challenge and replayability.  

It is closer to a **simulation of trust, survival, and realism** than a conventional narrative game.

## Core Conflict Engines

### Shifting Allegiances (The Social Puzzle)
- NPCs shift alliances as goals, fears, and resources change.  
- Player loyalty choices create ripple effects.  
- Ambiguity is the default state: every ally could be a rival under new pressures.  

### Versus Hannibal Lecter (Nemesis Duel)
- A head-to-head duel with a logically consistent antagonist.  
- The Nemesis follows a fixed internal script: no randomness.  
- Mistakes by the player are immediately and ruthlessly exploited, whether socially, physically, or psychologically.

## World Rules
A framework for how environments, NPCs, and resources behave:  
- **Fixed Map**: The game world exists in full before the player enters.  
- **Logical Consequence**: Time and resources are always the filter for choices.  
- **Assume Normality**: Legal and social rules apply until extraordinary or survivalist triggers justify looting, escape, or confrontation.  
- **No Movie Logic**: Physical and biological rules follow reality, not narrative shortcuts.

## Niche Realism Clarifications
Examples of encoded edge rules that prevent clichÃ© outcomes:  
- Armor: knights in plate are mobile; mobility â‰  clumsiness.  
- Combat: grappling and precision thrusts are favored over wide swings.  
- Materials: drywall cannot stop bullets; layered wood or metal can.  
- Wounds: fatigue, shock, and blood loss follow real physiological rules.  
- Small arms: daggers and utility blades are critical for finishing armored foes.
